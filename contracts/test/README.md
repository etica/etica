# Important note: These tests were written with Truffle and need to be migrated too Hardhat

This directory contains tests written with Truffle framework. Truffle announced the termination of the support for its framework at the end of 2023, as a consequence the project switched to Hardhat framework for handling deployment and testing. These tests need to be migrated to Hardhat. You can use legacy-versions/v1 to run these tests using Truffle.
